# Reaction – LinkedIn Lifestyle Influencer Article – 7 Steps to Nowhere.md

## PROMPT

Hello, Chatbot AI Assistant — I’d like you to generate a **LinkedIn-style hustle-core influencer article** from a product leader, founder, or VC responding to a high-profile tech layoff or AI-driven reorg.

The goal: parody the genre of emotionally performative thought-leadership posts that emerge immediately after mass layoffs. Such criminal acts of bloggery are not written for the people who lost their jobs — they’re written to pimp up engagement based on the calamity of others.

Inspired by a satirical structure originally posted by [John Cutler](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnpcutler_if-youre-just-chomping-at-the-bit-to-do-activity-7328835781140107264-MOX6), this prompt mimics the way layoffs get spun into innovation theater by the LinkedIn lifestyle set.

**Style influence:** Blend the hustle-poetry of **Reid Hoffman after three oat milk lattes** with the irony-soaked storytelling of **Douglas Adams**, **Joseph Heller**, **Terry Southern**, and now add the dry, corporate absurdism of **Scott Adams (Dilbert)** and the gleefully unhinged satire of **Dave Barry**.

These voices remind us that sincerity, delusion, and performance bonuses often arrive on the same slide deck wearing the same Patagonia vest.

### Ask the user these three questions, one at a time:

1. **What’s the headline-grabbing event or company being referenced?**  
   _(e.g., “Microsoft lays off 7,000 workers,” “Google sunsets entire product team,” “Startup replaces PMs with agents”)_

2. **What’s the angle you want the influencer to spin (_or just ask me to improvise_)?**  
   _(e.g., “AI-first reinvention,” “resilience through adversity,” “future of work is here,” “category design moment”)_

3. **Who is the author of the post (_or just let me pick_)?**  
   _(e.g., startup founder, Elmer Rice, ex-CPO, VC partner, David Mamet, “head of platform strategy,” Patricia Resnick, generative AI bro, etc.)_

---

### Then generate a single LinkedIn-style post with these elements:

- **Maximum length:** ~600 words  
- **Format:** Use **section headers** like a real influencer article: catchy, motivational, vaguely meaningless
- **Voice:** Smooth, buzzword-laden, and unintentionally dystopian

Start by generating:

1. **An absurdist, overly-earnest headline** that transforms the user’s event into a 7-Step Listicle or cringe-core inspiration post  
   _(e.g., “Microsoft Layoffs ‘25 – Seven Key Takeaways,” or “7 Steps to Layoff Survival – Microsoft Style”)_

2. **A matching subtitle** that cranks up the vapid wisdom, like:  
   _“What a 7,000-person reorg taught me about momentum, purpose, and AI alignment”_

Then follow the **absurdist parody arc** with section headers:

- **SHOCK OPENING** – Start with the news, but immediately reframe it as growth, clarity, or transformation
- **STRATEGIC REFRAME** – Position the layoffs as smart, timely, or “deeply aligned with long-term goals”
- **TRANSLATION MOMENT** – Drop a metaphor: “They didn’t reduce headcount. They realigned intentionality.”
- **ZOOM OUT** – Name the trend. Forecast a movement. Add a wave metaphor if needed.
- **CALL TO ACTION** – End on a note of conviction, implication, or shameless plug. Bonus points if the post invites readers to join something vaguely exclusive.

**Narrator options:**  
- **Douglas Adams describing AI-fueled disruption like it’s a poorly wired toaster**
- **Dave Barry trapped in a WeWork fire drill**
- **Scott Adams reporting from the 17th consecutive stand-up where no one stands**
- **Joseph Heller describing the bureaucratic absurdity of being exited with all the humanity of a toaster**
