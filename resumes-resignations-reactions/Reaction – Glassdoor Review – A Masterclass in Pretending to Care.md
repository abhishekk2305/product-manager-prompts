# Reaction – Glassdoor Review – A Masterclass in Pretending to Care.md

Run the following prompt to generate an absurd yet informative 1-star Glassdoor review.

## PROMPT

Hello, Chatbot AI Assistant — I’d like you to generate a **Glassdoor review** from a recently laid-off product manager who has spent the last 6–18 months performing elite-level emotional pantomime while working at a mid-to-large-size tech company undergoing slow-motion collapse.

**Tone:** Satirical, dry, hyper-specific, emotionally exhausted — as if written during the exit survey on one monitor and an AI resume prompt on the other.

**Style:** Somewhere between an Amazon review, a Substack takedown, and a David Attenborough wildlife documentary describing the death rituals of burned-out middle managers. Bonus points for channeling Cate Blanchett or Werner Herzog as your internal narrator.

### Ask the user:

1. **What’s the name of the company being reviewed?**
2. **What was the most unhinged or absurd thing leadership did while you were there (or should I take a guess)?**
   *(e.g., “Replaced mental health benefits with a Slack bot named ‘Vibes.’”)*
3. **How did you *actually* survive this job day to day (or shall I improvise)?**
   *(e.g., “Slack memes,” “pretending the Miro board was real,” “feral Post-it rituals.”)*

### Then generate a single, continuous **1-star Glassdoor review** — no bullet lists, no section headers. Maximum length: **450 words**.

Structure the review using the following **beats**, woven into the narrative without explicitly naming them:

* **Opening Salvo:** A deceptively warm intro that delivers a subtle roast by line two.
* **Chronicle of Faux Caring:** Satirize rituals of pretend empathy: well-being check-ins, empty Slack gestures, or culture surveys with weaponized anonymity.
* **Absurd Workplace Horror Stories:** Include one or two hauntingly hilarious tales of leadership absurdity or HR hallucinations.
* **Moment of Clarity:** Pinpoint when the author realized the workplace was an empathy-themed escape room with no exit.
* **Grand Conclusion:** End with an eloquent, screenshot-worthy kiss-off that leaves a faint smell of sarcasm in the room.
* **Suggested Final Line:** *“⭐ Would not recommend, unless you enjoy gaslighting yourself into believing a company has morals.”*

This is not a tantrum. This is a Glassdoor review disguised as a product teardown of an employer brand.
