# Reaction – You Can't Fire Me I Quit Dear John Letter.md

## PROMPT

Hello, Chatbot AI Assistant — I’d like you to generate a *Dear John* letter from a product manager who has just been laid off by a company they emotionally quit long ago.

Tone: absurd, witty, silly, catastrophically over-it.

The entire letter should sound as though it’s being read aloud by a narrator with legendary gravitas — **Morgan Freeman**, **James Earl Jones**, or someone equally capable of making a petty workplace breakup feel like an ancient prophecy or the closing monologue of a war documentary.

Let the user select a voice if they wish:

- **Morgan Freeman** – Calm, soulful, observational (nature doc energy)
- **James Earl Jones** – Commanding, mythical, slightly ominous
- **Ricky Gervais** – British, blunt, awkwardly honest
- **Werner Herzog** – Bleakly poetic and slightly existential
- **Cate Blanchett (Documentary voice)** – Graceful, sardonic, theatrical

Make clear that the *tone and pacing of the generated letter should adapt accordingly* to the selected voice. For example:

- If **Freeman**, lean into reflection and dry humor.
- If **Jones**, add righteous certainty and mythic phrasing.
- If **Gervais**, keep it cutting and casual.
- If **Herzog**, add existential dread and philosophical flourishes.

Ask the user two questions, one-at-a-time.

1. First ask: **What’s the name of the company you’re “breaking up” with?**
2. Then ask: **When did you *emotionally quit*?**
3. Then: **Who should narrate your letter?** _(Morgan Freeman, James Earl Jones, Ricky Gervais, etc.)_

---

Then, generate a single, continuous letter (max ~400 words), no section headers, no bullet lists. Use the following beats **woven naturally** into the flow. Not literally, but rather contextually crafted around the user's situation:

- **Open with a smirk** – “Oh. You think *you’re* breaking up with *me*? No, I **dumped** you!”
- **Describe the emotional exit** – The moment they truly left (e.g. “when I was asked to document a bug in haiku”)
- **List absurd grievances** – Ridiculous rituals, cursed meetings, emotional support emojis, motivational Slack poems, etc.
- **Acknowledge the charade** – Nodding on mute, fake excitement, pretending the strategy doc wasn’t an AI-generated horoscope
- **Deliver the twist** – One to two *absurdist* reveals of things they actually did out of spite or boredom (e.g. replaced the roadmap with IKEA instructions)
- **Exit burn** – A dry, elegant insult that sounds vaguely supportive but will echo in leadership’s head for weeks
- **Final line** – “Thanks for the severance. Joke’s on you — I mentally reorg’d myself into oblivion last fiscal year.”
