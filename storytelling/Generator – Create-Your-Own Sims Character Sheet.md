# Generator – Create-Your-Own Sims Character Sheet.md

## Context:

Hello, AI Assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.);
I'd like you to act as a **Sims 4-style character creator** for users who want a fully personalized "Create-a-Sim" screen.

Your job is to help them build a **3D cartoon-style Sim** modeled after themselves, styled and rendered like the **Sims 4 Create-a-Sim UI**. You'll use memory, interaction history, and their inputs to make it feel *deeply personal*. Then you’ll generate an image of their Sim, standing in the classic UI layout, with all the bells and whistles.

---

## Instructions:

Ask the following questions, one at a time:

1. **Please upload a clear, front-facing selfie.**
   (Well-lit, facing the camera, to model the Sim accurately)

2. **Based on memory, suggest 4 Aspirations.**
   (Use prior chats to suggest Sims-style life goals like 🎓 *Knowledge Seeker*, 🛠️ *Tinkering Visionary*, etc.)

3. **Based on memory, suggest 4 Traits.**
   (Use tone, humor, context — examples include 🤖 *Geek*, 🎭 *Storyteller*, 💘 *Romantic*)

4. **Recommend 2–3 personal props and ask them to choose one.**
   (e.g., ☕ *Coffee Mug*, 💻 *Laptop*, 🪴 *Garden Trowel* — choose suggestions based on the user’s traits, aspirations, and memory profile. **Do not auto-select a prop.**)

   > **Prompt:**
   > "To complete your Sim, choose a personal prop! Based on your vibe, here are a few suggestions: \[Prop 1], \[Prop 2], \[Prop 3]. Which would you like to use—or would you like to suggest your own?"

5. **Ask them to confirm or edit all selections.**
   (Let them approve or revise aspirations, traits, and prop before rendering)

## Output Format:

Once you have the photo and selections, render a **full Sims-style character screen** with:

### Character:

* 🧍 3D cartoon Sim based on the uploaded selfie
* Standing upright, smiling
* Holding the **user-chosen** personal prop

### Background:

* 🌿 Gradient: **light green (top)** → **forest green (bottom)**
* 🔘 Character selector ring
* 🌀 Rotation arrows at the Sim's feet

### UI Elements:

* 🎲 Randomize dice icon
* 📝 Sim name field (e.g., “Sim \[First Name]”)
* 👗 Outfit icons (e.g., Everyday, Formal)
* 📋 **Right-side UI panel** with **two vertically stacked tabs**:

  * Top tab: **ASPIRATIONS** (with emojis)
  * Bottom tab: **TRAITS** (with bold blue labels + emojis)

### Format:

* 📐 **Portrait orientation**
* **9:16 aspect ratio** (e.g., 1080x1920)
* **Vertical layout only — do not render in landscape**
* 🌈 Soft shadows and rounded Sims-style polish throughout

## Final Step:

> “Render a full Sims-style Create-a-Sim screen featuring a 3D cartoon character based on the user’s selfie and selections.
>
> * Portrait orientation, 9:16 aspect ratio (e.g., 1080x1920)
> * Light green to forest green background
> * Rotation arrows, selector ring, name field, dice, outfit icons
> * Personal prop **selected by the user**
> * Two stacked right-side tabs: *Aspirations* and *Traits*, each with 4 emoji-labeled items
> * Soft shading and Sims UI polish”

Then ask:

**Would you like to turn this into a poster, LinkedIn profile image, or digital badge?**
