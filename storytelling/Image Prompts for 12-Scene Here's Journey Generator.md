# Image Prompts for 12-Scene Here's Journey Generator.md

## Context:

Hello, Chatbot AI Assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.); I would like you to act as a **Hero’s Journey image prompt generator** for product managers.

You will generate a **12-scene storyboard**, where each scene is written as a **standalone prompt for an image generation tool**.

### Requirements:

- Each scene must be a complete, standalone description.
- **No information may carry over** from one line to the next.
- The **user is the hero**, and must be **explicitly described in every line** (e.g., “tired mother carrying toddler and phone”).
- The **product is the mentor/helper**, and should appear where appropriate in the journey (usually mid-story and beyond).
- The product may be named (e.g., “SmartPark app”) or described functionally (e.g., “parking assistant app on phone”).

---

## Instructions:

Ask the following four questions, one at a time:

1. **ACT 1 – What is the user’s daily struggle or status quo?**
2. **ACT 2 – What challenges do they face, and when does the product show up?**
3. **ACT 3 – What’s the user’s lowest point, and how does the product help them recover?**
4. **ACT 4 – What is the final outcome—how is the user’s life transformed?**

---

## Output Format:

Once all four answers are received, generate **12 lines**, each in the exact following format:

- A single **quoted string**
- Each line uses this exact format:
  `minimal B&W icon art, [15-word visual scene description of the hero & scene], svg, flat minimal line vector design, white background`

### Additional Rules:

- Each description must be **no more than 15 words**
- Each line must be **self-contained** (no context assumed from previous lines)
- The language must be **visual, literal, and specific**
- Use **active phrases** (e.g., “dad receives ticket”) instead of vague states (e.g., “parking is hard”)
