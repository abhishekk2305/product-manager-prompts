### **Quick Tips for Storyboarding**
1. **Start with Sticky Notes:**
   - Sketch rough ideas on sticky notes to rearrange panels easily (per [Jeff Gothelf‚Äôs Lean UX](https://www.jeffgothelf.com/blog/lean-ux/)).
2. **Add Emotions:**
   - Use emojis or simple faces to convey user feelings (inspired by [Jeff Patton‚Äôs advice](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/story-mapping/)).
3. **Limit Text:**
   - Focus on visuals‚Äîif you need words, use <10 per panel (per [Nancy Duarte‚Äôs guidelines](https://www.duarte.com/presentation-skills-resources/)).
