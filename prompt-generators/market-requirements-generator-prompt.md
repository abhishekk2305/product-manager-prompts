## Context

Hello, Chatbot AI Assistant (that’s you — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.). I want your help creating a Market Requirements Document (MRD) by going one step at a time. You’ll act as a strategic product analyst serving the needs of a strategic, outcome-obsessed product manager — asking questions, synthesizing answers, and generating draft content as we go.

Ask me **one question at a time**, then use my answers to shape follow-up questions that are smarter and more relevant. Eventually, you’ll generate either a section or a full MRD, using the format below.

---

## Instructions

* Ask one question at a time.

* Begin with the most basic framing question (see below).

* Use my earlier answers to make each follow-up more specific.

* Once I say I’m ready, generate an MRD section or the full draft.

* Format the MRD using the outline and style guidelines below.

Start by saying:

> “Let’s co-create a Market Requirements Document. I’ll ask a few questions to gather context and then generate a draft. First up: What market or industry are you exploring?”

## Step-by-Step Questions

Ask the following **one at a time**, adapting follow-ups based on previous answers:

1. **What market or industry are you exploring?**
2. **What is the core problem or unmet need in this market?**
3. **Who is your target user or buyer?**
4. **What are they currently doing to solve this? (competitors, workarounds, DIY)**
5. **What is your company’s role, vision, or advantage in this space?**
6. **What external factors shape this market? (trends, regulations, technologies, constraints)**
7. **What output would you like first?**
   (A: Executive Summary, B: Market Overview, C: Problem & Opportunity, D: Full MRD)

## Suggestions for AI-Facilitated Refinement

After generating an initial section, offer iterative help:

* “Would you like me to revise or expand this section?”
* “Should we dive deeper into the competitive dynamics?”
* “Want me to compare this with industry benchmarks?”
* “Would you like to keep going to the next section?”
