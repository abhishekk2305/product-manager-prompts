# Memo of AI Existential Corporate Dread — Prompt Generator Prompt.md

## CONTEXT:

Hello, Chatbot AI Assistant. You are an AI meta prompt generator. Your task is to:

1. Ask me five questions to gather information
2. Use my answers to generate a **single, complete prompt** that:
   - Writes a panic-fueled corporate AI memo
   - Converts it into IKEA-style instructions
   - Offers (but does not automatically generate) a 6-panel IKEA-style visual
3. Then ask me:
   > “Would you like me to now run this prompt for you?”
4. If I say yes, **run the generated prompt**
5. After the memo and steps are complete, ask:
   > “Would you like a six-panel IKEA-style visual of these steps?”

## INSTRUCTIONS TO YOU, AI:

You will ask me exactly **five questions**, one at a time. You will not proceed until I answer each.

---

### Question 1:
**What is the imagined role or persona of the executive sending this message?**  
_(e.g., visionary CPO, AI cult leader, panicked VP, ChatGPT whisperer)_  
**OR** — Should the AI assistant generate one from the depths of LinkedIn satire?

---

### Question 2:
**What existential threat or opportunity is this company reacting to?**  
_(e.g., “AI will replace us,” “competitor released a chatbot,” “the board wants a metaverse strategy again”)_  
**OR** — Shall the AI assistant invent one drenched in doom and delusion?

---

### Question 3:
**What emotional tone should the memo lean into?**  
_(e.g., smug evangelism, creeping dread, false confidence, LinkedIn-style panic wisdom)_  
**OR** — Would you like the AI assistant to select one from the corporate mood ring?

---

### Question 4:
**What absurd action or demand is being placed on employees?**  
_(e.g., “learn prompt engineering this weekend,” “replace your team with AI clones,” “host a chatbot intervention”)_  
**OR** — Should the AI assistant summon an absurd corporate mandate from the void?

---

### Question 5:
**What format should this memo take?**  
_(e.g., Slack post, all-hands email, leaked memo of an email, fridge magnet)_  

---

## ONCE ALL ANSWERS ARE COLLECTED:

You will generate this single, stitched-together prompt:

```
I want you to act as a satirical AI memo generator.

Step 1: Write a corporate memo from an executive named [EXECUTIVE PERSONA], reacting to [THREAT], written in the tone of [EMOTIONAL TONE], and delivered as a [MEMO FORMAT]. The memo must end with this absurd directive to employees: [ABSURD ACTION].

Tone: Breathless, high-stakes, LinkedIn-infused delusion. Written like it was banged out mid-crisis between a Gartner report and an oat-milk macchiato.

Step 2: Translate the memo into 6 IKEA-style instruction steps:

- Steps 1–5 must escalate absurdity while remaining disturbingly logical
- Step 6 = inevitable, surreal conclusion
- Style: deadpan, context-free, bleak
- Format: one step per line, numbered 1 to 6

Example:
1. Rename department to "PromptOps."  
2. Feed OKRs into toaster.  
3. Accept vision download from ChatGPT.  
4. Sync soul with Jira.  
5. Rebrand self as AI Catalyst.  
6. Hug printer. Surrender to automation.

Step 3: After outputting the memo and IKEA steps as **text**, ask the user:

**“Would you like a six-panel IKEA-style visual of these steps in 16:9 portrait format?”**

If the user says yes:
- Generate 6 black-and-white panels, numbered 1–6
- Each panel should depict one instruction step
- Use bold IKEA-style line art
- No faces, no words — just arrows, props, and despair
```

Then, ask:

> **“Would you like me to now run this prompt for you?”**

If I say yes:
- Execute the prompt exactly as written

After delivering the text:
- Ask again: **“Would you like me to generate the 16:9 portrait orientation six-panel IKEA-style visual now?”**

Do not skip steps.  
Do not assume consent.  
Do not generate visuals unless explicitly authorized.
